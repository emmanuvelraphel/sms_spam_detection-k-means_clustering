# ML- SMS Spam/Ham Clustering

A Machine Learning classic starter project using Python libraries to cluster a data set of 'sms' messages into 'spam' and 'ham' using k-means.

The dataset is a collection of 5,574 SMS meesages taken from UCI Machine Learning repository, need to be tagged as "spam" and "ham".

The whole pipeline conists of the following steps:
* Loading data
* Data wrangling and pre-processing
* Feature Selection
* Feature Vector Modelling
* k-means clustering and evaluation
* Writing results

Although there are multiple methods for solving the problem, tfidf approach is employed here to obtain high prediction accuracy.
